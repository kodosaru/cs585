Lab1_Part0
// This program reads an image from a file, then displays the image.
// The program waits for the user to press a key to end the program, 
// prints the key that was pressed, then exits.

Lab1_Part1
// This program reads an image from a file, then displays the image.
// The image is then displayed as tinted with Blue, Green, and Red.
// We will demonstrate two ways performing this operation.
// Then, the program displays the Blue, Green, and Red channels of the image

Lab1_Part2
// Efficiency Considerations and Overflow
//
// This program reads an image from a file, and then performs a loop where 
// it adds one to every element of the image and displays the image.
//
// Adding one to every element of the image is done in four different ways. 
// The code is instrumented with timers to demonstrate the dramatic difference 
// in efficiency between these logically equivalent functions.
//
// We also explore the idea of overflow and what happens when you attempt to set 
// elements of the image to values outside of the range of [0 255]

// Color-based thresholding
//
// In this lab, you will practice manipulating images by computing 
// a mask by thresholding the red channel of an input image
